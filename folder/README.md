# Quigley Dach Customer Analytics: Monthly Revenue Trend Analysis

This repository contains the Python script and the generated visualization for the "Monthly Revenue Trend Analysis" project. This analysis was conducted for a major retail client to help them understand and optimize their customer relationships through advanced analytics. The visualization aims to clearly communicate monthly revenue trends across different customer segments to their executive team and board of directors, supporting data-driven recommendations for seasonal revenue patterns.

## Files in this Repository

*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
*   `chart.py`: The Python script that generates the Seaborn lineplot visualization.
*   `chart.png`: The generated monthly revenue trend visualization (exactly 512x512 pixels).

## How to Regenerate the Chart

To regenerate the `chart.png` file, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure Python is installed** on your system (Python 3.7+ is recommended).
2.  **Install the required Python libraries** by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the directory** where `chart.py` is saved in your terminal.
4.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python chart.py
    ```
    This command will execute `chart.py` and save the generated chart as `chart.png` in the same directory.
